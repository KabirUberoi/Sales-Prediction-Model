# Sales Prediction using Machine Learning Models

This repository contains the implementation of various machine learning models for predicting sales based on a given dataset of product and store attributes. The models were developed and evaluated as part of **Project 7** for the course ELL409.

## Project Overview

The task involves predicting the sales (`Item_Outlet_Sales`) of products in specific retail outlets based on features such as product type, visibility, price, and store details. The dataset includes 8,000 records and requires splitting into training and validation subsets. The project evaluates both standard machine learning models provided by `scikit-learn` and custom implementations from scratch.

### Dataset Features

- **Product Features:** `Item_Weight`, `Item_Fat_Content`, `Item_Visibility`, `Item_Type`, `Item_MRP`
- **Store Features:** `Outlet_Identifier`, `Outlet_Establishment_Year`, `Outlet_Size`, `Outlet_Location_Type`, `Outlet_Type`
- **Target Variable:** `Item_Outlet_Sales`

The evaluation metric is the **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.
